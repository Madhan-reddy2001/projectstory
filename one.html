    <p>Mahesh Babu's character in SSMB 29 will have traits similar to Lord Hanuman. According to the Hindu mythology, Lord Hanuman travelled from India to Sri Lanka to save Goddess Sita. Like him, the Telugu star will also be seen travelling across the world in search of something. "Mahesh Babu's character will have traits similar to Lord Hanuman, who is known for his courage, strength, and fight against all odds in the jungles. The trajectory of Mahesh Babu's character will follow the route of Ramayana, but with a unique spin given by Rajamouli," a source told Pinkvilla about the film. Although these are just conjectures as this point in time, all eyes will be on the film when it begins rolling The story of SSMB 29 will be different from SS Rajamouli's previous films. Mahesh Babu will be shooting some intense action scenes in the African jungle. Not just in Africa, but the movie will be shot in several places around the world. Reportedly, Rajamouli will be travelling to Europe to shoot some parts of SSMB 29.</p>
    <p>Mahesh Babu's SSMB29 will reportedly be a trilogy, but the makers have not confirmed whether Mahesh Babu will be playing the main lead in all the three parts. The film is currently in the pre-production stage and the script is being written by Rajamouli's father Vijayendra Prasad. "My next film with Mahesh Babu will be a globetrotting-actioner. It will be like James Bond or Indiana Jones film with Indian roots,” he shared while speaking at an international film festival.SSMB29 will be Mahesh Babu's bigest film to date. About starring in the film, Mahesh Babu, "Doing one film with Rajamouli garu is like taking up 25 films at once. It’s going to be physically demanding and I’m really excited about it. It’s going to be a pan-India film. I hope we break many barriers and take our work to audiences across the country,” Mahesh Babu said on working with Rajamouli, according to media reports.</p>
    <p>According to the buzz, the movie will go on floors from August next year. The movie reportedly requires heavy computer graphic work & visual effects which might take a good number of three years. After the film's production begins in 2023, the movie will remain in production and post-production phase for a period of three years, most-likely. That means the movie will only hit the screens in the year 2026.
