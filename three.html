    <h2>Movie plot:</h2>
    <p>Plot
        In 1920, during the British Raj, Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad. There they abduct Malli, an artistically-talented young girl from the Gond tribe. Enraged, the tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. Elsewhere, the Nizamate of Hyderabad, sympathetic to the Raj, warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists A. Rama Raju, an ambitious officer in the Indian Imperial Police, to quell the threat. Seeking clues to Malli's whereabouts, Raju and his uncle, Venkateswarulu, attend several pro-independence gatherings where he feigns to support independence.
        
        Months later, Lachhu, Bheem's gullible aide, believing Raju's ruse, attempts to recruit him into Bheem's plot. He later discovers his true identity and flees. Shortly after, Bheem and Raju encounter one other, unaware of their opposing allegiances. While working in concert to save a boy from a train wreck, they form a friendship, gradually growing close. Raju assists Bheem in courting Jenny, Scott's niece, unaware that Bheem plans to infiltrate Scott's residence. When Jenny takes Bheem to her residence, Bheem locates the room where Malli is held captive; he promises Malli to free her. Meanwhile, Raju deduces Lachhu's true identity and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu goads a banded krait into attacking Raju, then warns him of his imminent fate and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds.
        
        Dazed, Raju approaches Bheem, who immediately tends to him. Noticing similar religious features between Lachhu and Bheem,<p> Raju deduces his true intentions. Nevertheless, Bheem divulges his tribal identity and his mission, still unaware of Raju's true identity. At an event to honor Scott, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, creating havoc among the guests. The animals maul Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly fight; however, Raju arrives and tells him Scott intends to kill Malli; he surrenders out of obligation. In the aftermath, Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, yet he is guilt-stricken over his actions, recalling his own pro-nationalistic background and his alter-ego as a mole within the police; he sought a promotion to gain access to gun shipments to smuggle to his village.
        
        At Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses flogging instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, which incites the assembled crowd into rebellion. The riot further enlightens Raju, who finally recognizes his reckless actions. Determined to save his friend, he persuades Scott to secretly execute Bheem while preparing an ambush to rescue him. Scott figures out the scheme. While rescuing Malli from Scott's men, Raju is grievously injured. Bheem, who freed himself, mistakenly interprets Raju's actions as an attempt to kill Malli; he bludgeons him and escapes with her. Months later, Bheem, who is hiding with his group and Malli in Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities. He narrowly avoids being exposed when Sita, Raju's fiancée, repels them by claiming there is smallpox epidemic.
        
        Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's anti-colonial objectives and his impending execution. Crestfallen upon realizing his own folly, Bheem vows to save him</p>. With Jenny's sympathetic assistance, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him. The pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate soldiers with a longbow taken from a Rama shrine. Taking the fight to Scott, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, setting it afire. Bheem steals a cache of guns for Raju before the barracks is destroyed. The subsequent explosion kills many within Scott's company, including Catherine. Having cornered a wounded Scott, Raju has Bheem execute him with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. Ram is reunited with Sita, and Bheem is reunited with Jenny and his family.
        
        To mark the mission's successful completion, Raju asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his community.</p>
        <p>In October 2017, in an interview with Variety, S. S. Rajamouli announced two projects after Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017) with producers D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment and K. L. Narayana. Rajamouli prioritised his work on the former, which was touted to be a social drama film, and which would be followed by Narayana's production with actor Mahesh Babu.[13] In November 2017, Rajamouli shared a picture with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan through his social media handles, hinting their inclusion in the film.[14]

            The film was announced in March 2018,[15] with the tentative title RRR, an abbreviation for Rajamouli, Ram Charan, and Rama Rao.[16] The tentative title RRR was later confirmed to be the film's official title as Rajamouli felt that a universal title across the languages was essential for a film of such scale.[17][18] Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad gave the original story and Rajamouli scripted the film, which he worked on for six months.[19] In September 2018, writer Sai Madhav Burra was signed for the dialogues for the film in the primary language (Telugu),[20] whereas dialogues in other versions were written by Madhan Karky (Tamil),[21] Varadaraj Chikkaballapura (Kannada),[22] Mamkombu Gopalakrishnan (Malayalam),[23] and Riya Mukherjee (Hindi).[24] Rajamouli retained several technicians from his previous projects. The crew consists of M. M. Keeravani as the music director, K. K. Senthil Kumar as the director of photography, A. Sreekar Prasad as the film editor, Sabu Cyril as the production designer, V. Srinivas Mohan handling the visual effects supervision, and Rama Rajamouli as the costume designer.[25] Nick Powell was the stunt director for the film, and handled the choreography for the climax action sequences in the film.[26] Prior to the start of film production, both Rama Rao and Charan had attended a special workshop in mid-November 2018, in order to train physically and intensively for their roles in the film.[27][28]
            
            RRR is an entirely fictitious story incorporating the lives of two real-life Indian revolutionaries, namely Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad respectively. Charan plays Rama Raju while Rama Rao plays Komaram Bheem. <p>The plot explores their stay in Delhi of the 1920s before they begin the fight for their country.[29] Rajamouli stated that there had been a coincidence between the two Telugu tribal leaders and the events surrounding over them.[30]
            
            When I read about Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, it was exciting to know that their story is similar. They never met each other. What if they had met? What if they had got inspired by each other? That is what RRR is about. It is completely fictitious</p>. The film is mounted on a very large scale. We had to do a lot of research for it. To know costumes, their dialect, their way of living and that is why it took so much time for us to get this together.

           <p> Alia Bhatt (top), Ray Stevenson (middle) and Ajay Devgn (bottom) made their debut in Telugu cinema (Tollywood) in this film.
            In March 2019, Rajamouli finalized the cast. The film marks the Telugu debut of Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt.[32][33][34] Bhatt was paired opposite Charan in the role of Sita, while Devgn would have an extended cameo.[35] Tamil actor Samuthirakani was roped in to play a crucial role.[34] British actress Daisy Edgar-Jones was signed to be paired opposite Rama Rao,[34] however, she left the project in April 2019 citing personal reasons, which later revealed to be scheduling conflicts to Normal People.[36] Olivia Morris was cast as her replacement in November 2019. <p>The same month, Irish actor Ray Stevenson was cast as the lead antagonist Scott, with Alison Doody joining in to play Lady Scott.[37] Chakri, Varun Buddhadev, Spandan Chaturvedi and Twinkle Sharma were the child artists for the film.[38]
            
            In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Rama Rao said that they had carried out major research to portray their characters on screen. He was put on an 18-month training programme to get the right physical appearance.[39] The Hans India reported in March 2019 that Devgn will appear in the second half of the film during the flashback episodes.[40] Reports claimed that Keerthy Suresh and Priyamani were approached for a role in the film,[41][42] before Shriya Saran confirmed her role opposite Devgn in June 2020.[43] Rahul Ramakrishna,[44] Chatrapathi Sekhar[45] and Rajeev Kanakala are cast in other supporting roles.[46]</p>
            
            In June 2020, Bhatt was trolled by the netizens following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, where she was accused of nepotism. A few fans also called to replace Bhatt in RRR.[47][48] However, Bhatt denied the news of her leaving the film and being replaced by Priyanka Chopra,[49] and joined the sets in December 2020.[50] She learnt to speak Telugu for the film.[51][52]</p>
